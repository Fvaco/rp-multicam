# RP Twitch Multicamera

RP Twitch Multiscreen is web app to to watch any number of Twitch streams at the same time.

## Why?

I'm a big fan roleplay games on Twitch since I've discovered them. One day I found myself opening multiple tabs in my browser and changing from one to other in order to follow all the stories from different characters perspectives. That's why I decided to build a multistream app for myself. Now it's open for anyone to use!

## Note
This is just a POC, there's still room for improvement. I'm actively working on this project but any suggestion, idea or PR would be more than welcome ðŸ™‚
