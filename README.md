# RP Twitch Multicamera

RP Twitch Multicamera is web app to to watch any number of Twitch streams at the same time.

## Why?

I'm a big fan of GTA V roleplay stories in Twtich since I've discovered them. One day I found myself opening multiple tabs in my browser and changing from one to other in order to follow all the stories from different characters perspectives. That's why I decided to build a multicamera app for myself. Now it's open for anyone to use!

## Notes

- I've added my favorite characters to the suggestion box in search input but the app works for any channel name you type.
- For now is just in Spanish but I'm planning to translate it to English as soon as possible. Stay tuned!
- There's still a lot of room for improvement. I'm actively working on this project but any suggestion, idea or PR would be more than welcome ðŸ™‚
